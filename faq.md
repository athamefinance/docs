# FAQ

## Can I withdraw?

While it's not possible to immediately withdrawal your initial investment, it is possible to create a proposal to liquidate one of our investments, i.e. sell an NFT then that capital would be distributed.

### What is the approval process? &#x20;

Smart contracts need approval from a wallet owner to essentially take your funds out of your wallet and deposit into the contract or send to another wallet.  This can be dangerous and I will explain with an metaphor.  Let's say you go to the store and make a purchase with a credit card, you are signing or approving the exact amount plus any taxes.  You are only approving that _exact_ amount.   This is exactly what a smart contract does but it's possible to approve over the amount of the "purchase".  Let's say you want to approve only 10 USDC but the contract approves 1000. The contract can take the 990 at any time since your already approved the transaction. As a best practice in the DeFi space always double check the amount. In MetaMask click the "Edit Permission" link.&#x20;

Here you will see if the amount is correct, same as you do with a credit card purchase.&#x20;
