# ATH Governance Token

As Athame Protocol moves to decentralize and diversify its governance, it will use the Athame Governance Token (ATH) to grant voting power. Alignment between governance token holders and protocol stakeholders is crucial for successful decentralized governance, and ATH tokens are the vehicle to drive this alignment. ATH tokens are not an investment; ATH token holders should be people who interact with the protocol in some way, are committed to its future development, and want a seat at the governance table.
