Athame Finance Governance is the heart and brain of Athame Protocol.&#x20;

Anyone can be part of the Athame Governance Process, and anyone with ATH voting power can vote on proposals. Governance makes decisions about new features and directions of where the ATHAME Protocol should go. Governance is the ultimate decision body for the Athame Protocol; no one can override vote results.&#x20;
