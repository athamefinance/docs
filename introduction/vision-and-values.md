# Vision and Values

## Our Vision

Our vision is to provide decentralized solutions and build a community that values the principles of decentralization and transparency.  Building a strong and tightly knit community will be one of our main goals from the moment we launch the platform.&#x20;

## Our Values

### Transparency

Our [contract repository](https://github.com/athamefinance/contracts) is open for all to view.  We also have all contract events for deposits, withdrawals etc. on the [Athame App](https://app.athame.finance).

### Governance

Governance is the cornerstone of Athame's protocol. Other platforms are lacking in this regard and fail to take community feedback into account when investing.  All decisions will be decided by vote, making the protocol truly decentralized. By putting our users first, we allow our community to shape the future of Athame Finance protocol.
