# Why DeFi as a Service?

Investing in decentralized finance projects is complicated and tedious. The process of moving your investment capitol into farms, performing all the steps to set up your earnings, and performing the steps to get your earnings off the farms is very complicated.  With centralized finance, the institutions do all the hard work and leave you to do the basic ones. DeFi is different, and its complexity is one of the major hindrances to its mass adoption.

We are striving to make investing in DeFi simple, completely transparent, community driven all with governance.&#x20;
