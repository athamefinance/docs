# Abstract

## Why Crypto?

The financial world is rapidly changing.

* Countries are printing money at historic rates and devaluing their currencies
* Creating money out of the ether dilutes your wealth
* In addition to providing value creation, DeFi is creating financial sovereignty
* The government prints money without visibility into inflation or tax revenue
* Central banks can close your account at anytime.

There is no doubt that the financial world is being rebuilt with smart contracts on blockchains.  In addition to "winning" and influencing our future, cryptocurrencies offer individuals a means to own a piece of the protocol. This is historic!

## Why DeFi as a Service?

Investing in decentralized finance projects is complicated and tedious. The process of moving your investment capital into farms, performing all the steps to set up your earnings, then performing the steps to get your earnings off the farms, is very complicated. With centralized finance, the institutions do all the hard work while you handle the basics. DeFi is different, and its complexity is one of the major hindrances to its mass adoption.

We are striving to make investing in DeFi simple, completely transparent, community driven, and governance based.

## The Problem

DeFi provides an incredible opportunity for true financial sovereignty. Much like the dot.com era, DeFi is the wild west of the Crypto world! &#x20;

Herein lies our next problem. While this is an exciting time to become an investor, it’s important to take your time and research each project before investing. There is no rush! Lots of newcomers are racing into crypto projects after watching a couple videos from Crypto influencers, boasting about lucrative amounts of money they’ve made in a short period of time. There is this illusion that it is so easy, and you too dream of making residual income to leave your job. These video producers are being paid to promote projects and incentivized to convince you to join. This is not doing your own research.

There are hundreds, if not THOUSANDS of high return-on-investment scams. Some obvious, some aren’t so obvious unless you do a thorough review of the contract. How many of us can spot a loop in a contract? Almost none.

Another side of the market economy is the invisible hand that publicly states prosperity for all, but is focused on their self-interests and financial gain, while the contract rapidly hits $0 and everyone else is left holding an empty bag.

Even if you are a veteran in this space, you can be deceived. A project that appears stable and shows profits on the exterior, while in the background a slow rug pull is quietly taking place and is outside of your control. Watching the invisible hand behind the scenes make a lucrative amount of money at your expense is excruciatingly painful and enraging.
