## Why Crypto?

The financial world is rapidly changing.

路       Countries are printing money at historic rates and devaluing their currencies

路       Creating money out of the ether dilutes your wealth

路       In addition to providing value creation, DeFi is creating financial sovereignty

路       The government prints money without visibility into inflation or tax revenue

There is no doubt that the world is being rebuilt with smart contracts on blockchains using tokens.

In addition to "winning" and influencing our future, cryptocurrencies offer individuals a means to own a piece of the protocol. This is historic!

## Why DeFi as a Service?

Investing in decentralized finance projects is complicated and tedious. The process of moving your investment capital into farms, performing all the steps to set up your earnings, then performing the steps to get your earnings off the farms, is very complicated. With centralized finance, the institutions do all the hard work while you handle the basics. DeFi is different, and its complexity is one of the major hindrances to its mass adoption.

We are striving to make investing in DeFi simple, completely transparent, community driven, and governance based.&#x20;
