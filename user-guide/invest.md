## Investing in Athame Finance

In order to invest in Athame Finance and become part of the investor community, you’ll need to buy the Athame (ATHF) token. &#x20;

To buy ATHF tokens, you’ll need to have [MetaMask ](https://metamask.io)wallet installed and some [**USDC**](https://www.centre.io/usdc) in your wallet. Once you have confirmed you have both items, you’ll need to connect to the Avalanche Network on MetaMask.

If this isn’t your first rodeo (or investment) and already know how to do this, skip to the next section. &#x20;

If you’re confused and have no idea what I’m talking about, I’ll walk you through the steps below.

To add Avalanche Network you can either add it through [chainlist ](https://chainlist.org)(various networks can be added here) or directly from the [Athame App](https://app.athame.finance).  Click the <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt="" data-size="line"> button.  MetaMask will popup and ask to add the correct network (Avalanche C-Chain).

If you do not have funds available you will need to [bridge ](https://bridge.avax.network)to Avalanche Network, if you do then skip to the next section.  If you are unfamiliar with bridging there are tutorials available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRHl-ulWK4-FPRA7SS1OrCOC8cOc2K8sP).

### How to buy Athame Finance tokens?

When you have USDC in your account you can buy tokens with USDC using the [Athame App](https://app.athame.finance).

Your USDC balance will display in the upper right corner. The token amount defaults to ten but you can purchase as little as one token. Each token costs ten USDC and is used for governance. With each purchase you will need to [approve ](../faq.md#what-is-the-approval-process)the smart contract access to your USDC so that those funds can be deposited into the contract.
