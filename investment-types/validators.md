# Validators

A crypto validator is a participant in a blockchain responsible for verifying transactions. When it determines the accuracy of a transaction, the validator adds it to the distributed ledger. This way, the legitimacy of the blockchain and, subsequently, its transparent functioning remain intact. Validators receive rewards for taking up a validator role.
