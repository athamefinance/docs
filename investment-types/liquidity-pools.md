# Liquidity Pools

You can earn passively by providing liquidity to pools. Automated market makers allow you to use your liquidity to trade liquid trading pairs. Liquid pairs are often subjected to high slippage, and the liquidity providers are seen as facilitators of such trades. Liquidity providers can fall victim to Impermanent loss, but sometimes, trading fees earned offset Impermanent losses.
